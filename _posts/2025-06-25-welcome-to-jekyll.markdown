You don't even need a radio or any software because, enthusiasts around the world 
have generously installed SDRs and made them available on the web.  All you need 
is an internet connection, a web browser and some help to get started.


The guide is a presentation to show you the basics.  Essentially your web connection allows you to listen in and control an SRD remotely and the guide show you:

 * Examples of web SDRs and where you can find others
 * How to control kiwiSDR, which is one of the most common
 * How to record IQ data for further processing
 * Examples of processing recorded signals using GNU Radio
 * Some of the dedicated decoders available via web SDRs
