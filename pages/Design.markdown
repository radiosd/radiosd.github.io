 RDS has extensive experience in military and commercial radio systems, successfully 
completing a wide variety of projects ranging from specialist radar receivers, 
EW and intelligence gathering radios, instrumentation such as spectrum analysers and 
high volume products for cellular communications. 


Products are designed for specific customers and are necessarily 
confidential.  However in broad terms these include products for receivers 
and transmitters. Specifically low noise radio preamps and front ends 
for various frequency bands, generally below 6GHz. Both fixed and 
tunable filters for enhanced receiver dynamic range  and GaN power amplifiers.


There are in house factilites for RF CAD and microwave  product testing, 
with a  well equipped laboratory for noise, network and spectrum analysis 
as well as other equipment to support RF and digital test signal generation.

Successful design examples include:
 * A range of low noise tower mount amplifiers for mobile phone bands
   * Individual Tx or Rx bands or options
   * Combined duplexed output options
 * A medium power GaN amplifier for the InmarSat band
 * Low loss tunable front end receivers for enhanced sensitivity WiFi receiver
 * RS232 and RS484 remote control receiver front ends
 * Low cost HF tunable SDR HAT for raspberry pi SBCs
