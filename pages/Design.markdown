 RDS has extensive experience in military and commercial radio systems, successfully completing a wide variety of projects ranging from specialist radar receivers, EW and intelligence gathering radios, instrumentation such as spectrum analysers and high volume products for cellular communications. 


Products are designed for specific customers and are necessarily 
confidential.  However in broad terms these include products for receivers 
and transmitters. Specifically low noise radio preamps and front ends 
for various frequency bands, generally below 6GHz. Both fixed and 
tunable filters for enhanced receiver dynamic range  and gaN power amplifiers.


There are in house factilites for RF CAD and microwave  product testing, 
with a  well equipped laboratory for noise, network and spectrum analysis 
as well as other equipment to support RF and digital test signal generation.
