There are 2 courses currently available: <br/> 1. Essentials of Radio Communications Systems <br/>2. Hands on Software Defined Radio (SDR)|


Public courses are available by request from [CEI-Europe](https://www.cei.se/instructor-profile-richard-g-ranson) and 
[R&S technology Academy](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/cloud/store/US/en/USD/c/training?query=sdr:relevance:allCategories:training:tacProductFormat:CLASSROOM). 
The next scheduled courses are in Fleet Hampshire, Oct 2-3.


 * The 3 day Essentials of Radio course condenses years of industrial experience in radio systemss 
into managable topics that cover all the important aspects.  See this [summary](/pages/EoRadComm) for more information. 

 * The 2 day SDR course is a practical approach to understanding the mathematical basis of digital 
signal processing (DSP) using actual radio hardware to solidify the understanding. See this [summary](/pages/HoSDR) for more information. 
for a more complete description.


For those wanting to get started with understanmdin SDR, there are 
the notes from a [lecture](/assets/pdf/WebSdr.pdf) available which act
