Over more than 40 years I have worked on numerous interesting and challenging projects.  
The nature of many projects means that much of the work is confidential so, out of the 
many papers and presentations over the years this is a selection of publishable highlights.

<!-- [Introduction to Web SDR] -->
 * [Introduction to Web SRD](/assets/pdf/WebSdr.pdf)
 * [Practical uses for   your nano VNA](/assets/pdf/RSGB_Convention-2023.pdf)
 * [Software  Defined Radio](/assets/pdf/A_NewGoldenAgeOfRadio.pdf)
 * [Using Your nVNA to Demistify RF Filters](/assets/pdf/RadCommArticle.pdf)
 * [Measurement Automation using Python](/assets/pdf/MeasurementAutomationusingPython.pdf)
 * [Microwave Filter Design from a Systems Perspective](/assets/pdf/S403-004-2.pdf)
 * [Power Amplifiers](/assets/pdf/PowerAmpTrends.pdf)

Also please look at the [downloads](/pages/downloads.html) page for some of my favourite papers.  Links on the web come and go, so I have saved the pdfs here for others to use and keep for themselves. 

I will also add to this as time and disk space allows.
